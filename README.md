# SimpleFrontalFaceDetection
This project is a simple implementation of a frontal face detection algorithm using a haar cascade classifier.


This guide explains how to use a simple face detection algorithm to detect faces in images.

1. Clone the repository on your folder.

2. Run the script (main.py), it should run without problem if you have cv2 folder on the working directory.

3. A windows will pop up with your working camera, you can setup more than one camera, but by default it works with one, it will immediatly start to recognize frontal faces .

4. When you want to close or stop the windows, just press the key "q", it will close.
